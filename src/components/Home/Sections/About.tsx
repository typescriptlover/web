            ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self taught software engineer born and raised in
            Willemstad, Curacao who specializes in full-stack development
            including large scale applications from front-end to back-end, using
            a wide variety of skills to complete any task. I've always had a
            passion for coding; i remember seeing it for the first time when I
            was just about 13 years old; it intrigued me like nothing I'd ever
            seen before. i knew i wanted to master it and ever since then i
            haven't stopped learning and writing code; i became very good at it,
            from PHP HTML CSS to complex and modern frameworks, it has been a
            fun obstacle. My dream is to work remotely while creating many
            projects, whether it be open source or a product that I'm passionate
            about, as I learn more things along the way from friends I'll meet.
