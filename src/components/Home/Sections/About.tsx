            ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self taught software engineer born and raised in{' '}
            Willemstad, Curacao who specialises in full-stack development
            including large scale applications from front-end to back-end, using
            a wide variety of skills to complete any task. I've always had a
            passion for coding, i remember seeing it for the first time when i
            was just about 12 years old and thinking "this looks so hard" it
            intrigued me like nothing i'd ever seen before, i knew i wanted to
            master it and ever since then i haven't stopped learning and writing
            code and i became very good at it.
