## ðŸ§  Concept

Allowing writers, thinkers or anyone to express and manage their thoughts through notes on an interactive and easily navigable spatial canvas, with a sleek and fast interface.

## ðŸ’» Design

_Simplicity_, _consistency_, and _intuitiveness_ are the **main focus**.

Let's break down the **design system** one by one:

### Colors

A _clean_ and _consistent_ **dark mode** palette.

#### Background and Borders

`Black Pearl` being the **main** color, and off of that using **2% tint** on each color in the palette for _consistency_.

<Palette
   colors={[
      '#393c3d',
      '#343739',
      '#303234',
      '#2b2d2f',
      '#26282a',
      '#212325',
      '#1c1f20',
      '#171a1c',
      '#121517',
      '#0d1012',
      '#080b0d',
   ]}
/>

#### Text

a _simple_ `White` for the **main** color, and tailwind's `Zinc` for **shading**.

<Palette
   colors={['#FFFFFF', '#f4f4f5', '#e4e4e7', '#d4d4d8', '#a1a1aa', '#71717a']}
/>

### Font

I find `Inter` to be a _modern_ font that adds a _soft_, and _sophisticated_ touch to any design. Its excellent _readability_ makes it a go-to choice for many of my **design projects**.

### Icons

Incorporating icons to represent **actions** and utilizing **tooltips** to put a name to them makes an interface _clean_ and _compact_, and whenever I'm creating an **icon-heavy** interface I use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

## ðŸ–¼ Canvas

A different but scalable approach to a spatial canvas developed from scratch using pure Elements, DOM events, React refs, React hooks and State management without relying on the Canvas API.

I figured using the Canvas API here wasn't entirely necessary and there could be a different approach and customizable way of developing a reactive canvas from scratch, so I did, and in doing so challenged myself to approach several problems and learned a lot, whilst also making a lot of things possible and easier to implement.

## ðŸ›¢ Storage

I didn't want user data stored anywhere, and I wanted the user to have full control of their own data, whilst also being serverless, costless and instant.

### First approach

I implemented a React hook for easily updating and reading data from the browsers localStorage, and used it for canvas and notes storage.

I later realized that this approach had several long-term drawbacks with notes storage:

-  Storing large amounts of JSON stringified objects inside a localStorage key.
-  Having to completely rewrite the stringified value for said key every time an update happens.
-  Error handling on incorrect or faulty data.
-  Parsing and traversing an entire object to find one note and update it.

_I didn't like it._

### Working approach

I researched on best practices for locally storing data, and came across a library called **PouchDB** that allows me to do exactly what I want with notes storage, whilst also giving me type-safety.

I kept canvas storage inside localStorage because the data itself won't become larger or complex, but rewrote the entire notes storage system for scale.

_And now I'm happy._
